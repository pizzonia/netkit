K2.8
  - Instructions for building a custom filesystem image have been moved from
    the netkit-kernel (7) man page to the README file.
  - Enabled kernel automounter (autofs) and filesystem in user space (fuse)
    support.

K2.7
  - Fixed a bug in the function that computes a predictable MAC address for
    virtual network interfaces. Collisions in the function being used
    frequently caused duplicate MAC addresses. Now a SHA1 hash is used instead.

K2.6
  - Upgrade to kernel 2.6.26.5.
  - Upgraded to the MPLS kernel framework version 1.962.
  - Kernel patches have been cleaned up and are now more self-documented. Also,
    patches to MPLS-enable the Netkit kernel are shipped in the kernel package.
  - Enabled support for VDE transport, i.e. the ability to connect virtual
    machines to the improved fork of the uml_switch offered by the Virtual
    Distributed Ethernet project.
  - Enabled support for pcap transport, i.e. the possibility to attach a
    read-only virtual network device to a filtered stream of packets collected
    from host interfaces.
  - Support to other miscellaneous protocols (e.g., L2TP, Bluetooth) is now
    enabled. Support to other protocols has been dropped in favour of more
    recent alternatives (e.g., CIFS instead of SMB).
  - Enabled support for multiple IPv6 routing tables.
  - The kernel package now includes a makefile to ease the creation of custom
    kernels.
  - Instructions to build a custom kernel for use with Netkit have been moved
    from the netkit-kernel man page to the README.
  - Network interfaces are now assigned a pseudo-random MAC address, which is
    computed based on the virtual machine name and the interface ID.

K2.5
  - Introduced support to MPLS.
  - IPv6 is now compiled as a module.

K2.4
  - Renamed the base directory of the kernel tree from netkit2 to netkit.

K2.3
  - Improved performance thanks to the support for SKAS0 mode introduced since
    2.6.13.
  - Introduced support for link features including delay, loss, duplication,
    reordering, etc. Emulation of these features is provided by the NETEM packet
    scheduler.
  - Introduced support for auditing and for the SELinux infrastructure.
    
K2.2
  - Simplified (and fixed) deploying of Netkit kernel modules. The
    simplification consists in the fact that explicitly dealing with symbolic
    links is not needed any more: just run `make modules_install' with a
    seasonable INSTALL_MOD_PATH and that's it. Try `man netkit-kernel' for more
    information. The fix consists in the fact that, before this release, it was
    not possible to use modules for a kernel whose version did not match the one
    expected by the Netkit filesystem.

K2.1 Beta
  - Fixed a bug which limited the maximum number of arguments on the UML kernel
    command line (as a consequence, virtual machines could not be configured
    with more than about 6 interfaces, depending on the other options passed
    to vstart).
  - The port-helper patch supplied with the Netkit kernel was erroneously
    reversed. Fixed.

K2.0 Beta
  - A new 2.6.11.7 kernel has been recompiled from scratch. The kernel
    configuration has been completely revised. Minimal patches have been applied
    to provide for better stability.
  - Support for module loading has been introduced, so that the kernel
    configuration now includes basic commonly used functionalities as built-in
    pieces, while most of the other features are available as modules.
  - The kernel should now work flawlessly also with SKAS-patched host kernels.
