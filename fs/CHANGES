F5.2
   - Installed strace (bug #8).
   - Fixed some warnings during the startup of virtual machines when using
     terminals different from xterm (mainly due to improperly handled escape
     sequences).

F5.1
  - Resized filesystem image to 10GB.
  - Documentation about the filesystem, as well as the procedure to build a
    custom image, have been moved from the netkit-filesystem (7) man page to the
    README file.
  - The procedure to resize (enlarge) the filesystem is now described in the
    README file.
  - Fixed an error that prevented predefined lab tests to run properly (/sbin/ip
    could not be located by the netkit-test-phase script).
  - Fixed an error that prevented virtual machines from automatically shutting
    down after running tests.
  - The order of user-defined tests and predefined tests has now been reversed.
    Also, a sleep has been introduced to run the predefined test after the lab
    has settled if no user-defined test is found.
  - Solved permissions problem in importing lab files from the host to the guest:
    instead of simply preserving the original permissions (which may, for
    example, allow access only to the current user - in Netkit, root -), now
    the user's permissions bits are reflected to the group and others.
  - Created some additional directories (bug #6).

F5.0
  - The filesystem image has been rebuilt from scratch, thus including the most
    recent release of each packet.
  - The filesystem package now contains a lot of additional files that can be
    used to build a custom Netkit filesystem. Among these, there are patches to
    MPLS-enable basic routing tools (Quagga, ebtables, iptables, iproute) and a
    set of makefiles and scripts that automate the process of building a
    filesystem image. Please refer to the README file before using them.
  - The contents of the man page netkit-filesystem have been moved to the
    README file.
  - The ebtables package is now correctly installed (was broken in F4.0).
  - Problems in stopping Quagga related daemons have been solved.
  - Quagga is preconfigured to communicate with the SNMP agent snmpd.
  - Other problems with keyboard layouts (e.g., misaligned command line when
    typing accented letters) have been solved.
  - The vi editor now features a slightly fancier configuration (syntax
    highlighting, remember last position in file, etc.).
  - Improved command line completion.
  - iproute, ebtables, iptables, and quagga are provided both in their
    MPLS-enabled versions and in their original versions from Debian packages.
    The latter files are prefixed by the name orig-. Notice that, if you intend
    to use the plain original versions, you may also need to replace some
    applicable libraries inside /lib or /usr/lib, which have also been renamed
    with the orig- prefix.
  - A password for the root account has been set (it is "root").
  - The locate database is populated.
  - Packages arptables, dnsmasq, pdns-recursor, and tunctl have been added.
  - If a Netkit lab contained a virtual machine whose directory was actually a
    symbolic link, files were not copied correctly to the virtual machine
    filesystem. Fixed.

F4.0
  - Filesystem rebuilt from scratch.
  - Introduced support for MPLS in system tools and routing daemons.
  - Recompiled Quagga with SNMP and MPLS support. The vtysh is now supported.
  - Updated tools to the most recent available ersion at the time of the
    release.
  - Installed XORP.
  - Optimized startup time scripts (and, therefore, startup time).
  - Made information collected by the default test procedure a bit more
    significant (sorted outputs, etc.).

F3.0
  - Renamed the base directory of the filesystem tree from netkit2 to netkit.F3.0

F3.0a
  - Several packages have been installed and upgraded, including openswan,
    racoon, ppp, dhcpd, shorewall, ulogd, squid, nmap, ssldump, ettercap, snort,
    libpam, freeradius, snmp, tcpreplay, tcpreen, smcroute, pimd, mrd6, emcast,
    atftpd, and tftpd.

F2.2
  - Cleaned up /etc/hosts (it contained some wrong entries associating 127.0.0.1
    with "pc1").
  - Lab .startup files are taken into account even if they are not executable.
    This impacts the Netkit filesystem because it requires a change in the
    virtual hosts init scripts.
  - Boot time scripts processed the lab.conf file improperly. This caused
    warning messages when using the [mem] parameter or when defining interfaces
    for virtual hosts having particular names (e.g., containing a dash).
  - The "expect" package has been installed.

F2.1
  - Moved the /lib/tls/ directory away (UML does not support Thread Local
    Storage yet). Its presence caused some tools not to work (e.g., nslookup).
  - Foreign (i.e., user provided) Netkit kernel modules were properly recognized
    only if the kernel version matched 2.6.11.7. Fixed.

F2.0 Beta
  - Virtual machines boot messages have been deeply cleaned up.
  - Maximum number of days between mounts and maximum number of mounts before
    filesystem check have both been reset to 0. You won't go through those
    annoying file system checks any more!
  - Support for two console terminals is provided.
  - All console terminals now use automatic login as root. You will no longer
    have to enter the password hundreds of times when starting your labs...
  - Filesystem now provides support for kernel modules. That is, it provides a
    set of modutils to manage modules and some scripts automatically mount a
    host directory containing kernel modules, if this is found to exist.
  - Netkit startup scripts have been cleaned up and improved.
  - Fixed wrong minor number for device /dev/ubd/disc0/part1. Also, the following
    devices have been created:
    /dev/ubda
    /dev/ubda1
    /dev/ubda2
    /dev/ubdb
    /dev/ubdb1
    /dev/ubdb2
  - Support for automatically performed lab testing has been introduced.
  - Static mappings in /etc/hosts and the resolver configuration in
    /etc/resolv.conf have both been cleaned up.
  - Default passwords for zebra, bgpd, and ripd have all been set to 'zebra'.
  - Several tools have been installed and a list of installed packages is now
    being distributed.
