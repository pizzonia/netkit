INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS for Netkit
====================================

PRECONDITIONS
-------------

Netkit only runs under the Linux operating system. The toolkit is fairly
independent from of the specific Linux distribution you have.

It is strongly advised that you have an installed X server which provides you
with a graphical environment. Netkit virtual machines can also be started in
text only virtual terminals, but this limits considerably the flexibility when
you have to start and manage several machines simultaneously. If you choose to
start virtual machines inside windows of the graphical environment, you need to
have a terminal emulator application like xterm, konsole, or gnome-terminal
properly installed on your machine. Please refer to the documentation of your
Linux distribution for information about installing these applications.

In principle, there is no restriction on the host filesystem Netkit can be
installed on. However, installing it on a non-standard Linux filesystem (e.g.,
FAT32) is likely to cause performance losses and malfunctions. We *strongly*
recommend to install Netkit on an ext2/ext3 filesystem. Most Linux distributions
adopt ext3 as a default choice.


INSTALLING NETKIT
-----------------

Starting from Netkit version 2, a complete Netkit distribution consists of three
different packages:
- the Netkit "core", which contains commands, documentation and other stuff
  which is necessary for Netkit to work;
- the Netkit filesystem, which contains the filesystem for virtual machines;
- the Netkit kernel, which contains the kernel used by virtual machines.

Please always make sure you are using the most recent available releases of the
three packages. Upgrading some of them while leaving others stale may cause
unpredictable malfunctions of the Netkit environment.

--- STEP 1: DOWNLOAD AND UNPACK ---

Download all the files to a directory of your choice. Then unpack them by using
the following commands:

  tar -xjSf netkit-x.y.tar.bz2
  tar -xjSf netkit-filesystem-Fx.y.tar.bz2
  tar -xjSf netkit-kernel-Kx.y.tar.bz2

Note that all the three packages must be uncompressed while staying in the same
directory. It is strongly advised to use the -S option to save space on your
disk, because this option handles sparse files (i.e., files with lots of empty
blocks) efficiently.

Once Netkit has been unpacked, no root privileges are required to configure it
and start working.

--- STEP 2: CONFIGURATION ---

The first step is to set the environment variable NETKIT_HOME to the name of the
directory Netkit has been installed into. Versions of Netkit prior to 2 used
variable VLAB_HOME. Such variable is supported as well, but you are encouraged
not to use it. In order to access the Netkit man pages, the MANPATH variable
must be set to ":$NETKIT_HOME/man". For example, assuming that you have
installed Netkit to /home/foo/netkit and that your shell is bash, you would use
the following commands:

  export NETKIT_HOME=/home/foo/netkit
  export MANPATH=:$NETKIT_HOME/man

It may also be useful to put these lines inside your shell initialization file
(`.bashrc' in case you are using the bash shell). Consult your shell
documentation for more information about this.

After doing this, you need to update your PATH environment variable to include
the path to the standard Netkit commands. This is required in order to make
Netkit work properly. The entry you need to add to the PATH is
"$NETKIT_HOME/bin". For example, assuming Netkit is (still) installed into
/home/foo/netkit and that your shell is (still) bash, you would type:

  export PATH=$NETKIT_HOME/bin:$PATH

Again, it may be convenient to put this line inside your shell initialization
file.

--- STEP 3: CHECK YOUR CONFIGURATION ---

At this point, change the current directory to the Netkit directory:

  cd netkit

Now, run the `check_configuration.sh' script by typing:

  ./check_configuration.sh

This script takes care of checking whether your system is configured properly to
make Netkit run. Any misconfigurations are signalled and instructions for fixing
them are reported as well. If the script exits with success, then Netkit is
ready for use.

We suggest reading the documentation by starting from the man page netkit(7).


TESTING YOUR INSTALLATION
-------------------------

In order to test whether Netkit is working properly, you can start a simple
virtual machine by issuing the command:

  vstart pc1

If everything is in place, you should see a new virtual machine starting up
(eventually popping up an xterm window) and the command `vlist' on the host
machine should show an output which is similar to the following:

  vlist

  USER        VHOST               PID  UPTIME         SIZE  INTERFACES
  foo         pc1               24102  00:03         12376

  Total virtual machines:       1    (you),        1    (all users).
  Total consumed memory:    12376 KB (you),    12376 KB (all users).

You can stop the virtual machine by typing the following command on the host
machine console:

  vhalt -r pc1

You can now delete the file pc1.log.


COMMAND AUTOCOMPLETION
----------------------

As an additional feature, users of the bash shell can take advantage of command line autocompletion for Netkit commands (supported starting from release 2.7).
In order to activate it, first of all make sure your shell is bash:

  readlink -f $SHELL

If it is, then you can safely add the following line at the end of your ~/.bashrc file:

  . $NETKIT_HOME/bin/netkit_bash_completion
